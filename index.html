      <p><img src="img\stockdoc.jpg" align="center" /><br>UC San Diego is one of the leading centers for the treatment of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare pulmonary hypertension disease caused
        bychronic clots in the pulmonary arteries, which can result in right heart failure. CTEPH is often curable by pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) surgery, but there
        is a small population of patients that experience postoperative residual hypertension. Therefore, there is a need for a minimally invasive method to better identify
        prognostic biomarkers for PTE candidates. This will be useful for elucidating CTEPH pathobiology, as well as providing clinicians with a set of characteristic
        parameters to measure preoperatively to improve CTEPH treatment.</p>
      <p>In partnership with UC San Diego’s Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory (CViL), our team of senior bioengineering undergraduates worked to develop a method of
        generating patient-specific CTEPH simulations using CircAdapt, a mathematical model of the human heart and circulation. In doing so, from our simulations, we measured
        parameters characterizing heart and vessel function that are not routinely evaluated in patients currently. We also analyzed the prognostic value of these identified
        parameters to determine the usefulness of our developed simulation method in a clinical setting.

      <h2>CTEPH</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="/img/fig1_CTEPH.jpg" />
        <figurecaption><br><b>Figure 1:</b> The pulmonary emboli (arising from a recurrent pulmonary embolism or in situ) leads to endothelial remodelling in the small
          vasculature in the unoccluded part of the pulmonary vasculature similar to idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. The added resistance leads the right heart increasing
          in volume (hypertrophy) to maintain cardiac output, which eventually fails and leads to decompensation of the right heart and dyssynchrony between the left and
          right heart.</figurecaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a form of pulmonary hypertension (PH) caused by an increase in resistance due to significant organized
        thromboembolic material that is not properly reabsorbed by the body after a pulmonary embolism. The chronic clots impede blood flow in prominent pulmonary arteries and
        lead to small vascular disease and PH due to vascular remodeling from the increased flow and shear stress in the unoccluded area of the vasculature. Patients with CTEPH
        experience shortness of breath, chest pain, and have limited cardiac output response to increased physiological demand. CTEPH eventually leads to right ventricle heart
        failure because the heart must overcome the added pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and gets remodelled. Studies report between 0.6-4.6% of PE patients (of which there
        are around 900,000 a year) develop CTEPH.<sup>1</sup> Although it is suggested that there are 12,000 cases per year, CTEPH is considerably underdiagnosed since there are
        only 500-2,500 diagnosed cases every year.<sup>2</sup> The lack of risk factors predicting CTEPH from acute pulmonary embolism has prevented the development of
        preventative measures and screening programs due to the similar symptoms to those of other conditions.3 Patients with CTEPH are also often misdiagnosed with other
        cardio-respiratory diseases because CTEPH symptoms are nonspecific.<br><br>
        Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) currently provide a curative solution. The aim of PTE
        is to remove the pulmonary artery obstruction to decrease the PVR, but approximately 10-15% of patients that have undergone PTE have unexplained persistent or
        recurrent PH after the procedure.<sup>1</sup> Since CTEPH is underdiagnosed, patients who unknowingly have had CTEPH for years face greater risk of residual hypertension after
        surgery. <b>As a result, there is a need to learn about operable CTEPH by computational modeling in order to better diagnose the disease in its early stage.</b><br><br>
        Identification of risk factors using computational modeling of CTEPH will allow physicians to provide better diagnosis for CTEPH patients, particularly at UCSD where
        most CTEPH cases are handled. This model could allow patient specific simulation that can be analyzed by the physician to help understand the particular patient’s
        hemodynamic status. The model could provide another metric for physicians to analyze by putting together measurements collected in echographies, right heart
        catheterizations, CT scans, and other CTEPH diagnostic measurements. An in silico predictive model can increase PTE success rate by providing more information
        that a physician could use to understand a patient’s condition and propose appropriate treatments. This model could potentially drive a push in the CTEPH field to
        standardize criteria for what constitutes an operable disease, since different expert centers have varying standards. This is evident by the fact that every CTEPH
        expert center publishes different statistics regarding the percentage of CTEPH patients that are deemed operable. In the long term, the model will allow physicians
        to provide more accurate and specific predictions on how PTE will affect patient’s condition. This will be an improvement to the traditional approach of relying on
        more anecdotal experiences of past surgical outcomes since CTEPH is an orphan disease and could increase attention for CTEPH, which is often overlooked when
        cardiorespiratory patients are being diagnosed. Researchers would also benefit because this model will allow them to identify important parameters that could improve
        understanding of CTEPH, as well as elucidate new treatment options.<br></p>
        <img src="img\fig2_circAdapt.png" align="right" />
        <h2>CircAdapt</h2>
        <p>CircAdapt is a closed loop, lumped parameter cardiovascular mathematical MATLAB that uses a system of differential equations to simulate beat-to-beat hemodynamics
          and mechanics using around 30 state variables.<sup>4</sup> Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the CircAdapt model, with the PuArt, Pu, and PuVen of
          particular interest to us for modelling CTEPH.<sup>4</sup> CircAdapt can be run on a personal computer and is open-source and computationally inexpensive. It allows real-time simulations at different parameter values or
          disease states. The model is composed of muscular chambers, elastic tubes, valves and peripheral resistances.<sup>5</sup> The program was last updated in 2015, and
          researchers at the University of Maastricht have since focused on observing the effects of pathological-specific conditions and testing hypotheses concerning mechanics
          of the heart.<sup>6</sup> The principle advantages of building upon this model to create a patient-specific CTEPH model is that it is composed of modules that are fairly
          adaptable if it is ever realized that the program should be modified in order to simulate the disease. CircAdapt was also chosen for this project because of the work
          done on idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (small vascular disease arising independently of clots formed in the pulmonary arteries), which will serve as our starting
          point to this project.<sup>7</sup><br><br>
          The greatest disadvantage with CircAdapt is that it is a lumped parameter model that treats hemodynamic elements as a series of equivalent elements in an electric
          circuit. It was only with tremendous advancements in physiological knowledge that CircAdapt was able to function using meaningful physiological values. There are
          numerous required and often unknown parameters that make it difficult for the model to match normal physiology, let alone diseased states.</p>

      <p>Our project was to test the resolution of CircAdapt for CTEPH and develop a patient specific fitting algorithm. The final implemented design solution is a method to
        investigate potential prognostic or risk factors for CTEPH that are most indicative of good or bad surgical outcomes in the already existing CircAdapt model. This will
        allow us to determine if what we are trying to obtain (patient specific simulations of CTEPH to understand the pathobiology of the disease and shed light on PTE outcome)
        is already within CircAdapt or if future work should be done to build a more detailed pulmonary module, which will require more than a quarter to complete.
        Hypothetical CTEPH simulations were performed in three cases: (1) A resistive form due to microvascular disease (idiopathic PH), (2) CTEPH arising from stiffness in
        the pulmonary arteries, and (3) CTEPH induced by both resistive and stiffness elements. <b>Patient-specific simulations were created for 36 CTEPH patients to collect
        measurements concerning the heart and the pulmonary vasculature that are not currently measured in patients preoperatively. Taking these measurements, Receiver
        Operator Characteristic (ROC) Curve Analysis was used to identify parameters that best separate and predict good and bad outcomes.</b></p>

        </figure>
        <p>In order to simulate CTEPH on a patient-specific basis, reference CTEPH simulations were first generated to cut down on computational time. This was done to
        initialize our patient-specific simulations to ensure that our simulations would converge to a steady-state solution already in bounds of the CTEPH/PH regime.
        Using our patient sample, we separated patients into low, medium, and high severity CTEPH groups based on their mPAP values and derived average preoperative
        measurements for these three CTEPH groups. These average preoperative measurements for each CTEPH severity are shown in Table 1. Starting from a reference
        simulation with normal hemodynamics and mechanical load obtained from CircAdapt, both the mPAP and the pulmonary artery pulse pressure were incremented by
        iteratively increasing the mean arteriovenous pulmonary pressure drop and the pulmonary arterial stiffness exponent, respectively, to create three simulated
        CTEPH patients with low, medium, and high severity CTEPH. Between each increase, AdaptRest and AdaptExc (adapt functions within CircAdapt) were run to allow the
        diameters and wall volumes of the heart to change to minimize shear stresses caused by the upticks in pulmonary pressure drops and pulmonary artery stiffness.
        Although AdaptExc was prescribed to be used along with increasing heart rate and cardiac output to simulate exertion (Walmsley, 2015), this was not done since
        this would drastically increase our computational time (which became a big issue), and patients with CTEPH typically cannot exercise due to their shortness of
        breath. A generalized schematic of this process for generating the CTEPH reference patients (and later the patient specific simulations) is shown in Figure 1.</p>
        <p>The mPAP and the pulmonary artery pressure drop were selected for fitting because these parameters account for the constant and pulsatile pressure loading
          conditions for the right ventricle and control the resistance and stiffness components of the model. This is a build off of Lumens’ dissertation where pulmonary
          pressure drop was increased to simulate pulmonary hypertension.<sup>1</sup><br><br>
          In our fitting algorithm, the mean arteriovenous pulmonary pressure drop was incremented by a large change, followed by AdaptRest (50 cardiac cycles) and AdaptExc
          (100 cardiac cycles) adaptations to allow for adaptations to the vessels and the heart. Depending on where the current simulation lies (either past or before the
          target mPAP with respect to the previous solution) the pulmonary drop was either halved or kept constant. This was done until the mPAP we are trying to fit was
          obtained after the simulation. Afterwards, the pulmonary arterial stiffness exponent was incremented by some large change, followed by the same adaptation protocol
          to match the pulmonary pulse pressure. Unlike pulmonary pressure drop which was able to increment continuously (using the previous solution as a starting point),
          this was not possible with the pulmonary artery stiffness exponent. This is due to CircAdapt’s nonlinear behavior in solving for pressures in the ‘ArtVenV2P’
          function and is something to consider for future investigation. If the mPAP and pulmonary artery pulse pressure values were not within 5% of target values, then
          this process went through iterations until this condition was met by alternating fitting mPAP or pulmonary pulse pressure. Figure 2, shows the dampening process we
          used for the simulation to settle at a desired mPAP or pulse pressure target shown in red. The patients used these three CTEPH reference simulations (low, medium,
          or high) as starting points using the same fitting algorithm to reach patient-specific values of mPAP and pulmonary artery pulse pressure.</p>
        <h2>ROC Analysis</h2>
        <p>Following patient-specific simulations, 30 different parameters that characterize general hemodynamics, heart function and vessel parameters were taken from all
          36 patients to perform ROC analysis. It is not possible to measure many of these parameters, but there are some that are measurable that aren’t currently being
          investigated that could potentially be correlated to patient outcomes after PTE which could lead to insight on CTEPH pathobiology, development, and have some
          prognostic value. <br><br>ROC curves evaluates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. In this case, a patient
          with a bad outcome was defined to have a postoperative mPAP of above 25 mmHg because pulmonary hypertension is defined as having a mPAP of above 25 mmHg.
          Conversely a patient with good outcome was defined as having a postoperative mPAP of 25 mmHg or lower. After categorizing our 36 patients by bad and good
          outcomes, we normalized each parameter to its binary response (i.e. bad or good outcome) for each patient using a linear regression model. An ROC curve was then
          generated for each parameter by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. For our analysis, the
          TPR was defined as the likelihood that the parameter of interest correctly predicts that a bad-outcome patient had a bad outcome for a select threshold value of
          that parameter. FPR was defined as the likelihood that the parameter of interest incorrectly predicts that a good-outcome patient had a bad outcome for that same
          threshold. A sample ROC curve for mPAP is shown in Figure 3. Finally, once all ROC curves were generated, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each
          ROC curve to quantify the performance of the parameter as a classifier of bad and good outcomes. A perfect classifier is defined to have an AUC value of 1.0,
          while a poor classifier has an AUC value of 0.5 and is equivalent to random guessing. The final AUC values of our ROC curve analysis can be found in Result
          Section.</p>
        <h2>Environmental, Social, Ethical, Health &amp Safety Issues</h2>
        <p>The principal concern for safety regarding this model is that while it is intended to be a diagnostic tool, the model itself should not replace any physician
          expertise, but serve as an aid for medical decisions. Ethical standards for medical research are to be met in research and development of the model, with
          safeguards to protect patient anonymity as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). All patient data received from UCSD’s
          Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center will be anonymized for patient-specific simulations. The model should not store any of the patient data to comply with HIPAA.
          Environmental protection, biocompatibility, sustainability, FDA regulations, and durability do not apply to computational models. It is only after this model
          is validated and proven reliable with CTEPH cases, such as the documented cases from the last five years, that there will be public acceptance by physicians for
          the model’s use in clinical applications. Working at UCSD in collaboration with the Sulpizio Cardiovascular Center is the perfect environment to build this
          model because UCSD treats more CTEPH patients in a year than any other institution. Thus, there are many available resources, such as greater patient datasets
          to integrate in our research and expert clinicians in the CTEPH field. It is only through experimental use at UCSD, the leading expert center on CTEPH, that
          this model can gain traction in the medical field and help propagate diagnostic insight to other centers.</p>
        <h2>Economics</h2>
        <p>There are no specialized materials or equipment required to build a prototype computational model. Currently, only preoperative CO, mPAP, PP, and
          postoperative mPAP, PP and CO were used. For future work, some of the data needed may include pressure waveforms and PVR measurements from right heart
          catheterizations and data generated by echocardiograms.<br><br>
          The costs for building the design will include four computers (8GB RAM Computer Standard Cost: $1,000) with MATLAB (Standard Individual Price: $2,150) for
          each team member. UCSD’s free Academic License of MATLAB will be used during the R&ampD of the model before attempting any commercialization. The CircAdapt
          source code (open-source) must be downloaded from the <a href="www.circadapt.org/downloads">CircAdapt Website</a></p>

      <p>As seen in Figure 1, Case I produced simulated mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) values that matched average preoperative values. However, fitting the mPAP alone
        and focusing solely on the resistive elements of the disease was not sufficient in matching the pulmonary artery pulse pressure (PP). Case II results were not shown
        because altering stiffness alone produced results that did not converge. Lastly, fitting both resistance and stiffness in Case III did yield results that best matched
        preoperative patient mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and pulse pressure (PP) values. Hence, Case III was used to the primary approach to initialize and create
        patient-specific simulations.</p>
      <p>In addition, we evaluated the pressure-volume loops (Figure 2) of the right and left ventricles (RV, LV)  and found that our simulations produced the expected
        physiological adaptations to the heart. As seen in Figure 2A, the pressure required to pump blood in the RV increases with greater CTEPH severity due to higher RV
        dysfunction and hypertrophy from the increased mechanical load to the right heart. Moreover, in Figure 2B, the LV end systolic and diastolic volumes decrease with
        greater CTEPH severity due to RV decompensation, leading to LV underfilling and leftward septal bulging.<br></p>

      <h2>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve Analysis</h2>
      <p>After conducting patient-specific simulations for 37 CTEPH simulations, we extracted 30 different parameters characterizing the function and qualities of the heart
        and blood vessels. After performing single-parameter ROC analysis for all 30 parameters, we found that the parameters listed in Table 1 best separate and predict poor
        PTE outcomes (having a postoperative mPAP greater than 25 mmHg) with area under the curve (AUC) values greater than 0.8. These parameters make clinical sense, because
        with the highest AUC values, PVR and mPAP have been previously shown to correlate with poor PTE outcomes. Meanwhile, the extent of resistance versus the stiffening of
        the pulmonary artery drives CTEPH and hence, plays a predictive role for PTE. RV-PV coupling is defined as the ratio between the arterial load and RV contractility,
        both of which describe RV function and the RV’s ability to transfer energy to the pulmonary vasculature. Finally, RVEF deteriorates with RV remodeling and is
        indicative of heart failure.<br><br>
        Once the top prognostic parameters were determined, we wanted to determine if the parameters derived from simulations added any prognostic value to current
        measurements that are measured by clinicians. These typical clinical measurements include the mPAP, PP, and cardiac output (CO), which have a combined AUC value of
        0.888. As seen in Table 2, the simulation-derived parameters, paired with clinical parameters, increase the AUC value for the most part. Therefore, simulation-derived
        parameters can provide clinicians with additional information to better predict PTE outcomes.<br><br>
        Based on the results, our method of iteratively fitting the mPAP and PP to produce patient-specific CTEPH simulations has many potential clinical applications.
        Currently, risk factors for CTEPH are not well-known or well-characterized because the disease is considerably underdiagnosed, and many of its symptoms are nonspecific.
        This makes it difficult for clinicians to find the best solution for treating individual CTEPH cases. Through our simulations, we can characterize an individual’s CTEPH
        profile and noninvasively obtain measurements of the heart and blood vessels that clinicians currently cannot measure due to the inaccuracy or invasiveness of the
        procedure. In doing so, clinicians can make more medically-informed decisions concerning which method of treatment, such as PTE surgery, is most suitable for the
        individual patient. Therefore, using our method, we hope to lower the rate of residual hypertension faced by CTEPH patients post-PTE surgery and hence, improve the
        curative success of PTE.</p>

      <h2>Future Directions</h2>
      <p>Previously, CTEPH was considered to be a more resistive, clot-based disease, but research over the years and confirmed by the work done in this project, has shown
        that CTEPH is a combination of microvascular disease and stiff vessels.<br><br>
        To move this project forward, we would want to optimize our simulations so that we can better fit patients and replicate CTEPH. Currently, we are only fitting the
        mPAP and the pulmonary artery pulse pressure, which directly affect the resistive and stiffness components of the disease, respectively, and describe the pressure
        loading conditions on the right ventricle. However, modeling CTEPH with these two parameters is simplistic. Hence, in order to better match physiology, it would be
        best to add complexity to our simulations by expanding the fitting criteria (trying to match diastolic pulmonary arterial pressure for example) to see if the AUC
        values increase.<br><br>
        We would also like to increase our patient population so that we can yield more reliable results, since the 40 patients analyzed in this project could very well be a
        narrow slice of the CTEPH population. It would also be good to run simulations  on patients with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension using our method to compare to CTEPH
        patients, since iPAH patients aren’t candidates for PTE in the first place. Increasing our sample would definitely help in the AUC calculations since our values are very
        rough to to the jagged nature of our plots (due to small patient sample) as seen in the Results section. Using our method, it would be interesting to investigate
        patients with more resistive disease, such as those with acute pulmonary embolism, to determine if there are any differences in surgical outcomes between patients with
        more resistive or stiff pulmonary hypertension. Also, we could evaluate if prognostic markers differ between patient types. In doing so, we can use our project to allow
        clinicians to better characterize different types of pulmonary hypertension and more effectively treat patients.<br><br>
        CircAdapt also simplifies the actual pulmonary vasculature and models it as a single resistive component. Our original project design was to change CircAdapt so that
        the pulmonary vasculature could be split into right and left lung by creating two resistive components in parallel to improve the accuracy of the model. However, due
        to time restrictions and the level of complexity, this project design was not pursued. From our experience this past year, we propose that before splitting the
        pulmonary vasculature into right and left lung, a resistive component should be added to the pulmonary artery. This could be initially investigated by modifying the
        bernoulli pressure drop across the pulmonary valve (RvPulArt seen in Figure 2 in the Background section) to simulate a clot before completely introducing a completely
        new module in CircAdapt.<br><br>
        In summary we propose this course of action for the development of better modelling of CTEPH in CircAdapt:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Modify pulmonary valve state variables (such as pressure loss through that element) to mimic a resistive element in the pulmonary artery.</li>
          <li>Create a separate module of the pulmonary artery to add not only resistance but impedance to the pulmonary artery (separate from those of the microvasculature).</li>
          <li>Split the lung module into left and right lung, or diseased and non diseased lung, to simulate the effect of the difference of perfusion in the microvasculature in CTEPH pathobiology.</li>
        </ol>
